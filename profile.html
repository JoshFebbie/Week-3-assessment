    <h2>Career goals and future.</h2>    
    <p>
        My career goals, as of now, are pretty simple. One of my goals is to
        become as proficient as I possibly can in a particular language, so that I can hone those skills and be 
        able to implement them as efficiently and practically as possible. If I can do this, then I should be able to prove
        to potential employers that I am a competent and capable 
        Web developer/programmer that is worthy of their employment.
